I’d like to thank Edward Kmett and Gershom Bazerman for checking my math
and logic. I'm grateful to many volunteers who corrected my mistakes and improved the book.

I'm grateful to Eric Niebler for reading the draft and providing the
clever implementation of \code{compose} that uses advanced features of

old fashioned template magic that did the same thing using type traits.
Good riddance!
