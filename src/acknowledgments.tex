I’d like to thank Edward Kmett and Gershom Bazerman for checking my math
and logic, and André van Meulebrouck, who has been volunteering his editing
help throughout this series of posts.

I’d like to thank Andrew Su on for rewriting my C++ monoid concept
code according to his and Bjarne Stroustrup’s latest proposal.

I'm grateful to Eric Niebler for reading the draft and providing the
clever implementation of \code{compose} that uses advanced features of
C++14 to drive type inference. I was able to cut the whole section of
old fashioned template magic that did the same thing using type traits.
Good riddance! I'm also grateful to Gershom Bazerman for useful comments
that helped me clarify some important points.
