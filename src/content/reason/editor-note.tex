\lettrine[lhang=0.17]{T}{his is the} ReasonML edition of \emph{Category Theory for Programmers}.
It's been a tremendous success, making Bartosz Milewski's blog post series available as a nicely-
typeset \acronym{PDF}, as well as a hardcover book. There have been numerous contributions made
to improve the book, by fixing typos and errors, as well as translating the code snippets into
other programming languages.

I am thrilled to present this edition of the book, containing the original Haskell code, followed by
its ReasonML counterpart. The ReasonML code snippets were converted from the OCaml snippets which were
generously provided by \urlref{https://github.com/ArulselvanMadhavan/ocaml-ctfp}{ocaml-ctfp} contributors,
and slightly modified to suit the format of this book.

To support code snippets in multiple languages, I am using a \LaTeX{} macro to load the code snippets
from external files. This allows easily extending the book with other languages, while leaving the
original text intact. Which is why you should mentally append the words ``and ReasonML'' whenever you see
``in Haskell'' in the text.

The code is laid out in the following manner: the original Haskell code, followed by ReasonML code.
To distinguish between them, the code snippets are braced from the left with a vertical bar, in the primary
color of the language's logo, \raisebox{-.2mm}{\includegraphics[height=.3cm]{fig/icons/haskell.png}},
and \raisebox{-.2mm}{\includegraphics[height=.3cm]{fig/icons/reason.png}} respectively, e.g.:
