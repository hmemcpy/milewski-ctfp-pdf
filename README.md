This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS attempt to provide a version of the book <b>Direct link: [category-theory-for-programmers.pdf](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/releases/download/v1.3.0/category-theory-for-programmers.pdf)</b> with LEAN [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/about/) code.  Lean is a theorem prover and functional programming language.
 
This is a fork of the ["unofficial" PDF version](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) of the book.

Progress
--------
* Working on Chapter 1


Building
--------

The best way to build the book is using the [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager. After [installing Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html), if you're using a non-NixOS operating system, you need to install `nixFlakes` in your environment following the steps below ([source](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Non-NixOS)):

```bash
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nixFlakes
```

Edit either `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and add:

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

This is needed to expose the Nix 2.0 CLI and flakes support that are hidden behind feature-flags.

Also, if the Nix installation is in multi-user mode, donâ€™t forget to restart the nix-daemon. 

Afterwards, type `nix flake show` in the root directory of the project to see all the available versions of this book. Then type `nix build .#<edition>` to build the edition you want (Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Reason and their printed versions). For example, to build the Scala edition you'll have to type `nix build .#ctfp-scala`.

Upon successful compilation, the PDF file will be placed in the `result` directory inside the root directory `milewski-ctfp-pdf` of the repository. 

The file `preamble.tex` contains all the configuration and style declarations.
