This is an *unofficial* PDF version of "Category Theory for Programmers" by Bartosz Milewski, converted from his [blogpost series](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

---

Conversion is done by scraping the blog with [Mercury Web Parser](https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/) to get a clean HTML content, modifying and tweaking with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), finally, converting to LaTeX with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). See [scraper.py](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/blob/master/src/scraper.py) for additional information.

Please [report](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/issues) any formatting/content issues, or better yet, send a PR!

Building
--------

*For macOS Users:* The Inconsolata LGC, Linux Libertine, and Libertinus Math fonts are not included in MacTex. You need to install them separately. Download the Inconsolata LGC fonts [here](https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC/downloads), the Linux Libertine fonts [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine/files/linuxlibertine/5.3.0/LinLibertineOTF_5.3.0_2012_07_02.tgz/download), and the Libertinus Math font [here](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/libertinus-math). To install the fonts system-wide, move all the downloaded `.otf` files into the `/Library/Fonts` folder. After completing these tasks, continue with the instructions below.

The `src` directory contains the LaTeX sources. To recompile the book, go there and enter:

```bash
$ make
```

The file `preamble.tex` contains all the configuration and style declarations.

Chances for successful compilation are increased if you have almost complete installation of recent [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution (the PDF here is compiled with 2017 release). The needed OpenType fonts must be installed in the operating system.

To remove all the generated PDFs and auxiliary files in the whole `src` tree:

```bash
$ make clean-all
```

**Tip**: you can use a utility like [entr](http://entrproject.org/) to run a command after any `*.tex` file changes, e.g.:

```bash
$ ls **/*.tex | entr make
```

This will monitor all the `*.tex` files for changes, and will execute the `make` command if any of them changes. This speeds up development significantly, as you can freely modify any of the files, and get almost instant feedback!
